Abstract:
     In the digital era, the vast growth of educational content has increased the risk of plagiarism and content duplication. The Question Bank Plagiarism Checker Module addresses this challenge by combining advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and image comparison techniques to detect similarities in educational materials. It leverages transformer-based models like BERT and DistilBERT for semantic text analysis [1][7] and image recognition algorithms such as SIFT and ORB to identify duplicated visual content, including diagrams and charts [2][6].
Traditional plagiarism detection tools are often limited to string matching and fail to detect paraphrased or visual plagiarism [3]. In contrast, this system understands textual context and visual patterns, making it more effective in identifying reworded and visually similar content. The integrated approach ensures a higher detection accuracy while significantly reducing manual effort.By promoting originality and minimizing redundancy, the system enhances the quality of question banks and supports academic integrity. Its scalable architecture allows it to efficiently handle large volumes of educational content, making it suitable for institutions of all sizes. Overall, the module streamlines content validation and helps educators create diverse, authentic learning materials.

1. Introduction:
     The digital transformation of the education sector has revolutionized the way teaching and learning resources are developed and distributed. With the widespread adoption of online platforms and digital tools, educators now have access to an immense volume of learning content for creating assessments, quizzes, and question banks. While this growth has improved accessibility and convenience, it has also introduced new challenges, particularly in the realm of content duplication and plagiarism. As digital content is reused or modified without proper attribution, maintaining originality in academic materials has become increasingly difficult [10].
     Plagiarism in question banks can significantly impact the quality and fairness of assessments. Repetitive or duplicated content reduces the diversity of questions, limiting students' critical thinking and engagement. Moreover, it poses serious concerns related to academic integrity and intellectual property. In many cases, institutions rely on manual methods to detect plagiarism, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to error. These limitations call for automated systems capable of detecting both textual and visual duplication efficiently and accurately [11].
     Existing plagiarism detection tools such as Turnitin, Grammarly, and Plagscan focus primarily on text-based analysis using string matching or keyword comparison. While effective for detecting exact text matches, these tools often fail to identify semantically similar or paraphrased content [3]. Furthermore, they are generally ineffective in identifying visual plagiarism-an important concern in educational materials that include diagrams, charts, flowcharts, and illustrations [2].
     Recent advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and computer vision, offer promising solutions to address these challenges. Transformer-based NLP models such as BERT and DistilBERT can detect deep semantic relationships in text, enabling them to identify paraphrased or contextually similar content [1][7]. On the visual front, image recognition techniques such as SIFT and ORB can effectively analyze and compare visual content by extracting and matching image features [2][6]. These technologies provide the foundation for building a more robust plagiarism detection system that considers both textual and visual elements.
     The proposed Question Bank Plagiarism Checker Module integrates these advanced AI techniques into a unified system. By analyzing both text and image content for duplication, it offers a comprehensive approach to plagiarism detection. The system is designed to assist educators and institutions in maintaining originality, improving the quality of assessments, and upholding academic standards. This paper presents the architecture, workflow, and implementation of the module, along with experimental results and future directions for enhancing its capabilities.
2. Related Works:
     Plagiarism detection systems have undergone significant evolution over the years. Conventional tools like Turnitin, Grammarly, and Plagscan have established themselves as popular solutions for detecting text-based plagiarism. These systems rely heavily on string matching, keyword analysis, and phrase comparison techniques. While these methods are effective for identifying exact text matches, they often fail to detect paraphrased content, contextual rephrasing, or semantic similarities. Tools such as Copyscape also specialize in text duplication detection but lack robust features for visual content evaluation.
     To address these limitations, modern plagiarism detection systems have incorporated Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to improve accuracy in text analysis. Advanced NLP models such as BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT offer powerful language understanding      capabilities that enable them to capture deeper semantic relationships between words and sentences. These models utilize transformer-based architectures, making them highly effective for tasks such as text similarity analysis, question answering, and content rephrasing detection. As a result, NLP models have significantly enhanced the ability to identify closely related content that traditional keyword-matching techniques may overlook.
     In addition to text analysis, the need for visual content detection has driven advancements in image recognition techniques. Feature extraction methods such as SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) and ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) have gained prominence for identifying key visual patterns in images. These algorithms extract distinctive features from visual content, allowing for effective identification of duplicated diagrams, charts, and graphical elements commonly found in educational resources. While these methods excel in visual similarity detection, they do not address textual plagiarism, leaving a gap in comprehensive content validation.
     Despite significant progress in both text and image plagiarism detection, existing solutions predominantly focus on one domain while neglecting the other. The absence of integrated solutions poses challenges for academic institutions, especially in managing educational materials such as question banks, which often contain a mix of textual and visual content.
     The Question Bank Plagiarism Checker Module addresses these gaps by combining NLP models for text similarity analysis with image recognition techniques for visual duplication detection. This hybrid approach offers a comprehensive solution that ensures improved accuracy, enhanced reliability, and greater efficiency in identifying both textual and visual content duplication. By bridging the gap between text and image plagiarism detection, the system effectively meets the growing demand for robust academic content validation solutions.
